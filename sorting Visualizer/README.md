## Objective
To provide an engaging and intuitive learning platform for users to explore and understand sorting algorithms. The app offers interactive visualizations that simplify complex concepts for enhanced comprehension, particularly to benefit visual learners, like myself. I wanted to make this project an enjoyable learning experience by incorporating gamification-like elements to make learning both fun and effective.

## Purposes
* Learn React by utilizing its latest features and best practices to build a scalable single-page application.
* Enhance my JavaScript skills by learning new concepts and syntax. Especially the DOM manipulation features. 
* Solidify knowledge of common sorting algorithms by implementing and explaining them within the app.

## Installation
