# Graph:
- A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
 The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges. A graph can 
 be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices.
     Or
- A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) 
 represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are 
 used to connect these vertices.
