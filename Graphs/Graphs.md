# Graph:
- A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
 The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges. A graph can 
 be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices.
     Or
- A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) 
 represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are 
 used to connect these vertices.

# Graph Terminology:
### Path:
- A path can be defined as the sequence of nodes that are followed in order 
 to reach some terminal node V from the initial node U.

### Closed Path:
- A path will be called as closed path if the initial node is same as terminal 
 node. A path will be closed path if V0=VN.

### Simple Path:
- If all the nodes of the graph are distinct with an exception V0=VN, 
 then such path P is called as closed simple path.

### Cycle:
- A cycle can be defined as the path which has no repeated edges or vertices 
 except the first and last vertices.

# Types Of Graphs:
### 1. Null Graph
-  A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in the 
 graph.

### 2. Trivial Graph:
-Graph having only a single vertex, it is also the smallest graph 
 possible.

### 3. Undirected Graph
- A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That 
 is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

### 4. Directed Graph
- A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are 
 ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

### 5. Connected Graph
- The graph in which from one node we can visit any 
 other node in the graph is known as a connected graph.

### 6. Disconnected Graph:
- The graph in which at least one node is not reachable 
 from a node is known as a disconnected graph.

### 7. Regular Graph:
-The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to 
 K is called K regular graph.

### 8. Complete Graph
- The graph in which from each node there is an edge to 
each other node.

### 9. Cycle Graph:
- The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree 
 of each vertex is 2.

### 10. Cyclic Graph
- A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic 
graph.

### 11. Directed Acyclic Graph:
- A Directed Graph that does not contain any 
cycle.

### 13.Weighted Graph:
 - A graph in which the edges are already specified with 
 suitable weight is known as a weighted graph.
-  Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed 
 weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs.
